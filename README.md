# NBA Salaries Project

## Objective
This repository will house the code for my NBA salaries project, where I will be taking past NBA salaries and mapping them across positions and player ages to see how the distributions change over time. I hope to extend this to player statistics at a future point by layering it onto things like RAPM and player clusters.

## To Do:
- Fix outlier ages by manually filling in correct birthdates
- Plot position salaries by age
- Add 19-20 data in
- Keep brainstorming ways to see changes in position distribution over time
